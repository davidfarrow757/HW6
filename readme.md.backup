# OOAD Final project: Nevro
## By Carter Andrew & David Farrow

## Important info
1. Our project report pdf is in the repo and called Project Report.pdf, it is in the root directory
2. There is a link to the presentation video inside of the pdf. 
3. All important code is inside the Nevro folder
4. The code will not compile or run on anything outside of a apple licenced operating system and requires the xcode ide to compile. Along with this the folder structure is not actually representative of the project layout. 
5. This was built for the most recent version of ios/macos
